How to run the SINGLE.exe program in TimothyMasters\CompiledProgs\SINGLE.exe

This program was downloaded from http://www.timothymasters.info/
Statistically Sound Indicators by Masters (henceforth abbreviated SSI)
click on the "indicators" page to obtain the executables and the source code

Read SSI p. 250 and p. 251
We are going to run the SINGLE.exe program to produce the RSI_20 indicator based on OEX market data.
SINGLE.exe needs two inputs to run: MarketName (=OEX.txt) and ScriptName (=VX.txt)

To generate "OEX.txt" run FixYahoo2.py
OEX.txt contains the market data that SINGLE.exe uses to construct the RSI_20 indicator


To generate "VS.txt" open notepad and write:
RSI_20: RSI 20
save as "VS.txt"
RSI_20 is the indicator you want SINGLE.exe to produce using the OEX market data
Other examples of possible command lines inside this "VS.txt" can be found in TimothyMasters\MISC\SINGLE_DEMO.TXT

The following should now be in the same directory TimothyMasters\CompiledProgs\:
SINGLE.exe
VS.txt and
OEX.txt

open a terminal within TimothyMasters\CompiledProgs\ (or just double click cmd.exe)
within the terminal write:
SINGLE OEX.txt VS.txt

The SINGLE.exe program will run and generate a new file called TimothyMasters\CompiledProgs\OUTVARS.TXT
OUTVARS.TXT contains the desired indicator, in this case, RSI_20.



How to run the ROC.exe program described in his book pp. 19 ff.
ROC.exe appears to use two input files: OEX.txt and SIGNAL.txt

SIGNAL.txt is the same file that SINGLE.exe outputs (=OUTVARS.txt) which is
the file containing the indicator, but with the headers removed.

Run ROC.exe by double clicking the cmd.exe or
and writing:
ROC OEX2.txt SIGNAL.txt

OEX2.txt is the same as OEX.txt without the VOLUME. I think OEX.txt with VOLUME also works but have not tried it.

The output of ROC.exe is:
ROC.log
that contains the analysis of the RSI_20 indicator similar to the one described in pp. 22 and 36 of SSI.

So now we have to figure out more in detail what it all means.
In the example in the book p. 21 Masters analyzes a different indicator described on  p. 157
which you can generate using SINGLE.exe by changing VS.txt from "RSI_20: RSI 20" to:
CMMA_10_252: CLOSE MINUS MOVING AVERAGE 10 252
